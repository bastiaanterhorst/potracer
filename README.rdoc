== About Potrace

Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap into
a smooth, scalable image. A typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data,
such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image
is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.

== About Potracer

Potracer wraps the Potrace library in an easy to use Ruby binding. Input can be
in the form of a multi-dimensional array of 1s and 0s or string image data.
Suitable string data can be gotten from {Rmagick's}[http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/]
{export_pixels_to_str}[http://studio.imagemagick.org/RMagick/doc/image2.html#export_pixels_to_str]
or be crafted by hand.

== Usage
